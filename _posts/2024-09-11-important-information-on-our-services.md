We're back again with another post on our blog. This post will give you some information about the recent events with Netrocorp, along with services that will be changed or removed

N﻿etrocorp, our partner in helping us have a hosting system for our services, is set to cease their operations because of what's happening with their CEO's current job. The CEO of Netrocorp has been laid off last month, and this means that "funding for Netrocorp will be tight" as stated by them. Though we don't have a exact date on when their operations end, this will affect us greatly.

We have made some difficult decisions in response, and they are:

1. Our Mastodon instance will cease operations to prevent performance issues
2. T﻿TAuth will be removed because of its resource issues.

These were difficult to make, but we have to remove some services at times. We plan on picking a new Mastodon instance soon once we pick one out. We will update you on more information when we get it. Thank you for reading!
