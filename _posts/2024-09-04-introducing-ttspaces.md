We are happy to announce a service to the corporation! The service is called TTSpaces, a dev environment that works like your own computer. The concept of TTSpaces is simple. TTSpaces runs in a Docker container, in an isolated network. You get a simple Linux machine to work with, especially when you are developing an application! 😄

The service is free of charge and is free to use. If you want to request on using TTSpaces, contact us for a free instance for you to try out! Learn more [here](https://ttnrtsite.me/services/ttspaces) on how it works! 😁
